    <p class="lead">Welcome to <strong>Kernel ThinkSpace</strong>! I'm <strong>Pradyuman</strong>, a professional software developer, and this is my personal space for exploring, documenting, and understanding the Linux kernel. While my day job involves building software applications, I've embarked on this journey to understand the core that powers millions of systems worldwide.</p>
    
    <p>This project tracks my progress as I dive deep into various aspects of the Linux kernel, from process management and memory handling to kernel modules and device drivers. By breaking down complex concepts into simpler parts and sharing detailed insights from my learning journey, I aim to create a well-organized, easily understandable resource for anyone interested in understanding the inner workings of Linux, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer.</p>
